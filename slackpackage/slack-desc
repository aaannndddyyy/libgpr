# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libgpr: Making the inclusion of Genetic Programming easy within any C/C++
libgpr: application. Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful technique, inspired
libgpr: by the process of natural selection, which can be utilized to
libgpr: automatically discover programs which produce a desired input to output
libgpr: transformation. Both classical tree-based and Cartesian forms of
libgpr: Genetic Programming are supported, including self-modifying variants.
