Description: Headers and manual for the libgpr genetic programming library
 The aim of libgpr is to make using Genetic Programming easy to include
 within any C/C++ application. Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful
 technique, inspired by the process of natural selection, which can be
 utilized to automatically discover programs which produce a desired input
 to output transformation. The problem can be stated simply as:
 .
    "Given some behavior find a program which produces this behavior,
     or a close approximation of it"
 .
 Both classical tree-based and Cartesian forms of Genetic Programming are
  supported, including self-modifying CGP.
